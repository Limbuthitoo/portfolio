## Deploy to cPanel

### What you need

- cPanel hosting with **"Setup Node.js App"** feature
- Node.js 18 or higher
- SSH access (or cPanel Terminal)

### Step 1 — Upload your code

**Option A: SSH (recommended)**

1. Log in to your cPanel and go to **Security → SSH Access → Manage SSH Keys**
2. Generate a key or add your existing public key
3. Authorize the key
4. Connect from your terminal:

```bash
ssh your-cpanel-username@your-domain.com -p 22
```

> **Tip:** Some hosts use port `2222` instead of `22`. Check your hosting provider's docs.
> You can also use **cPanel → Advanced → Terminal** directly in the browser.

5. Clone your repo:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/Limbuthitoo/portfolio.git portfolio
```

**Option B: File Manager (no SSH needed)**

1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Zip the project (exclude `node_modules/`)
3. Upload via **cPanel → File Manager** to your home directory
4. Extract it to `~/portfolio`

### Step 2 — Create the app in cPanel

1. Go to **cPanel → Setup Node.js App → Create Application**
2. Fill in:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Node.js version | `18` or higher |
| Application mode | `Production` |
| Application root | `portfolio` |
| Application URL | Your domain |
| Startup file | `server.js` |

3. Click **Create**

### Step 3 — Add environment variables

In the same Node.js App page, add these variables:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `DASHBOARD_SECRET` | A random 32+ character string |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | Your password |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

Or create a `.env.local` file via SSH:

```bash
cd ~/portfolio
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
DASHBOARD_SECRET=your-random-secret-at-least-32-characters
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
EOF
chmod 600 .env.local
```

### Step 4 — Install and build

Via SSH:

```bash
source /home/YOUR_USER/nodevenv/portfolio/18/bin/activate
cd ~/portfolio
npm install --production=false
npm run build
```

> **Why `--production=false`?** Tailwind and TypeScript are dev dependencies but are needed to build the app.

Or just click **"Run NPM Install"** in cPanel, then run `npm run build` via Terminal.

### Step 5 — Start the app

Click **Restart** in **cPanel → Setup Node.js App**.

Your site is now live!

### Step 6 — Check it works

- Visit your domain — you should see the portfolio
- Visit `yourdomain.com/dashboard/login` — log in with your password

---

## Updating Your Site

After making changes and pushing to GitHub:

```bash
source /home/YOUR_USER/nodevenv/portfolio/18/bin/activate
cd ~/portfolio
git pull
npm install --production=false
npm run build
```

Then click **Restart** in cPanel.

---

## Deploy to Vercel (Alternative)

If you prefer Vercel over cPanel:

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables (`DASHBOARD_SECRET`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`)
4. Click **Deploy**

That's it — Vercel handles everything automatically.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| 503 error | Check `stderr.log` in your app folder |
| Blank page | Run `npm run build` again and check for errors |
| Can't log in to dashboard | Make sure `.env.local` has the correct password |
| Build fails | Make sure you're using Node 18+ and ran `npm install --production=false` |
| Static files missing | Check that `Application root` in cPanel points to the right folder |
